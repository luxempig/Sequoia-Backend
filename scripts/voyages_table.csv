The proposal would postpone the repayment of both capital and interest. Many, both in the United States and abroad, were outraged by this idea.[1] “In support of the Hoover Moratorium Laval undertook a year of personal and direct diplomacy by which he traveled to London, Berlin and the United States.” The US Congress did not approve the Hoover Moratorium until December 1931. Laval was found guilty of plotting against the security of the State and collaboration with the enemy, and after a thwarted suicide attempt, he was executed by firing squad in October 15, 1945.[5]

“Sunday, July 16, 1933 At eight o’clock this morning I met General Johnson at the naval airport at Anacostia where we boarded a Navy hydroplane to go down the bay to the President’s boat, the Sequoia. The weather was cloudy and heavy with a low ceiling, so that, generally speaking, we flew at about 500 feet. We were flying so low that the pilot didn’t want to run the risk of going over the land, so we kept pretty close to the river where we could come down easily, if necessary. It took us fifty minutes to reach the Sequoia. We landed nearby and a rowboat was sent for us. The President had eaten something Saturday that didn't agree with him, so we didn’t see him until one o’clock, when he appeared for dinner. After dinner he went to lie down again, but late in the afternoon he was out on deck. At two o'clock we weighed anchor and started up the Patuxent River, which is said to be the shortest and deepest river in the world. At the point where it flows into Chesapeake Bay it is 60 feet deep and for miles up the river it is very deep, although naturally it becomes somewhat more shallow. It was a beautiful ride up the river. The day was warm without being too hot and there was enough breeze to keep away the mosquitoes, and the scenery was certainly worth looking at. We dropped Colonel Howe at Benedict and went on up as far as we could. We had supper on our way down and all of us got off at Benedict where cars met us and brought us back to Washington. In the party besides those already mentioned were Under Secretary of Agriculture Tugwell, Captain Bernou, the President’s naval aide, and his personal secretary, Miss Le Hand. General Johnson and I had a chance to discuss matters with him somewhat briefly, General Johnson on the Industrial Recovery Control Administration, and I on Public Works. He approved some more of our public works projects, but he sent back to me for further study all items covering flood control and rivers and harbors improvements. He also authorized me, at my request, to take steps to proceed against the cattlemen in Arizona and New Mexico who have had many, many acres of the public domain fenced in for long terms of year is with the sanction of the preceding Republican administrations. I was home shortly after nine o’clock.”

During this period, Charles West arrived at Sequoia by seaplane, presumably to discuss the unfolding NRA issue. As the Sequoia sailed, it passed by the USS Arkansas and USS Wyoming. Both naval ships honored the President with a 21-gun salute.
In a related event, Jack Warner, having just arrived in New York City from Europe aboard the White Star Line with his fiancé Ann Alvarado, made his way to Washington, D.C., and then to Annapolis. There, he unexpectedly met director Frank Borzage, who was in the midst of shooting the movie ""Shipmates Forever"" for Warner Brothers at the Annapolis Naval Academy.","National Recovery Act of 1933
